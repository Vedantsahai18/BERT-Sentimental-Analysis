# BERT-Sentimental-Analysis

In this project, I learned how to analyze datasets for sentiment analysis, how to read it in a PyTorch BERT model and adjust the architecture for multi-class classification. Learning how to adjust an optimizer and scheduler for ideal training and performance. In fine-tuning this model, I learned how to design & train and evaluate a loop to monitor model performance as it trains, including saving and loading models. Finally, I built a Sentiment Analysis model that leverages BERT's large-scale language knowledge.
